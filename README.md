# Udacity Adventure Game Project

#### For my Udacity's Intro to Programming Course I had to make an Adventure Game using _Python language_! 

These were the requirements:
* The game gives players a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
* Something different happens depending on the choice the player made.
* The game also includes some `random` factors, so that it's a little different each time.
* The game has conditions for winning and losing.
* When the game is over, it asks if the player wants to play again.
